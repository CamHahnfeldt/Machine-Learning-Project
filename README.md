**Using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to Predict Basketball Game Outcomes**

**Description:**

In this project, we aim to preidct the outcome of basketball games using machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms. The models are trained on historical data, including team statistics and other relevant information. This is crucial to forecast game results with high accuracy.

**Installation:**

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 'git clone https://github.com/CamHahnfeldt/Machine-Learning-Project.git'
2. Install required Python packages: pip install matplotlib, pip install numpy, pip install pandas

**Data Sources:**

The data used for this project includes historical statistics from the NBA (National Basketball Association). It includes previous game ouutcomes and team statistics.

**Running Our Code:**

To run the prediction model:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Execute 'python main.py'
3. Results will be displayed in the terminal.

**Methodology:**

This project employs the following approach:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Cross Validation
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
